# Olympic Games Shiny app
This repository contains R code for a shiny app featuring data from the modern Olympic games. The dataset containing information on the Olympic games from 1896 to 2016 was obtained from the #TidyTuesday project located here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/readme.md

To use this app locally, you can download the `shiny` app in R, clone or download this repository, and run `shiny::runApp("app.R")`.
